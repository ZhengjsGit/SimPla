Differential Form {#concept_form}
======================================
## Summary
\note Let '''M''' be a _smooth manifold_. A _differential form_ of degree k is a smooth section of the kth exterior power of the cotangent bundle of M. At any point p∈M, a k-form β defines an alternating multilinear map
\f[
  \beta_p\colon T_p M\times \cdots \times T_p M \to \mathbb{R}
\f]
(with k factors of TpM in the product), where TpM is the tangent space to M at p. Equivalently, β is a totally antisymetric covariant tensor field of rank k.
