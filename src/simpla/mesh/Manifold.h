 * ## Summary
 * Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that
 *  uses the techniques of differential calculus, integral calculus,
 *  linear algebra and multilinear algebra to study problems in geometry.
 *   The theory of plane and space curves and surfaces in the three-dimensional
 *    Euclidean space formed the basis for development of differential
 *     geometry during the 18th century and the 19th century.
