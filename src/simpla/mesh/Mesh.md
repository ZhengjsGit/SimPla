Manifold (Differential Manifold):
=================================
 A presentation of a _topological manifold_ is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic
 to a linear space, by a collection (called an atlas) of homeomorphisms called _charts_. The composition of one
 _chart_ with the inverse of another m_chart_ is a function called a _transition map_, and defines a homeomorphism
  of an open subset of the linear space onto another open subset of the linear space.
