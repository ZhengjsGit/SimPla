## Terminology  
  

### Concept    {#concept_desc}
 @ref concept_desc :: In generic programming, a @ref concept_desc  is a description of supported 
 operations on a value_type_info, including syntax and semantics. In this way, concepts are related to 
 abstract base classes but concepts do not require a subtype relationship.

### 6-dimensional phase-space    {#phase_space_6d}
 @ref phase_space_6d ::    
   \f$ \left(x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z \right) \f$

### 7-dimensional phase-space   {#phase_space_7d}  
  @ref phase_space_7d ::
     \f$ \left(t,x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z \right) \f$
     
### configuration space  {#configuration_space}
  @ref configuration_space refer to  the base manifold of phase-space
  
  
### Attribute ,Property , Quality, Quantity
 - **Attribute** : The Attribute element defines values associated with the mesh.
 - **Property**  : a property is a characteristic of an object; 
   Example: _a red object is said to have the property of redness._
