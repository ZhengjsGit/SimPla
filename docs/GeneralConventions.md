### Concept  ###  

  In generic programming, a _concept_ is a description of supported operations on a type, including syntax and semantics. In this way, concepts are related to abstract base classes but concepts do not require a subtype relationship.  --  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_(generic_programming)
